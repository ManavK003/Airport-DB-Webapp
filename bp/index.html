  <h1>Airport Database Management System</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my database project for managing airport data, landings, flights, airlines, and pilots.</p>

  <h2>Project Problem</h2>
  <p>This project solves the problem of efficiently storing, managing, and analyzing airport operations using a PostgreSQL database. It provides structured data storage, easy querying, and operational insights for better decision-making.</p>

  <h2>SQL Queries Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Total Landed Weight by Airline:</b><br>
      <code>
        SELECT a.name AS airline_name, SUM(l.total_landed_weight) AS total_landed_weight<br>
        FROM landings l<br>
        JOIN airlines a ON l.airline_id = a.airline_id<br>
        GROUP BY a.name<br>
        ORDER BY total_landed_weight DESC;
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <br>

      <b>Total Landed Weight by Airline and Flight ID:</b><br>
      <code>
        SELECT a.name AS airline_name, f.flight_id, SUM(l.total_landed_weight) AS total_landed_weight<br>
        FROM landings l<br>
        JOIN flights f ON l.flight_id = f.flight_id<br>
        JOIN airlines a ON f.airline_id = a.airline_id<br>
        GROUP BY a.name, f.flight_id<br>
        ORDER BY total_landed_weight DESC;
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <br>

      <b>Total Number of Delays by Flight and Airline:</b><br>
      <code>
        SELECT d.flight_id, a.name AS airline_name, COUNT(d.delay_id) AS total_delays<br>
        FROM delays d<br>
        JOIN flights f ON d.flight_id = f.flight_id<br>
        JOIN airlines a ON f.airline_id = a.airline_id<br>
        GROUP BY d.flight_id, a.name<br>
        ORDER BY total_delays DESC;
      </code>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Insights from Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Airlines with higher total landed weights likely operate larger or more frequent flights. Major carriers like Delta or United Airlines are expected to dominate this category.</li><br>

    <li>Certain flights significantly contribute more to an airlineâ€™s overall traffic, either due to heavier aircraft or more frequent usage.</li><br>

    <li>Some flights and airlines experience significantly more delays, suggesting operational inefficiencies or external disruptions.</li><br>

  </ul>
