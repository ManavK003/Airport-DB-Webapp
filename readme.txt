A full-stack project to manage and explore airport, flight, and landing data using PostgreSQL, with plans to add a web interface (Flask/React).

This is a full-stack web app using Flask where I connected a PostgreSQL database, created dynamic routes to serve HTML templates, and returned data via API endpoints. I handled both the backend logic and frontend integration.

World Airport's Data from OpenFlights.org Database
Flight Tracking Data from OpenSky Network
Airport Delays from Flight Aware and Tracking Delays API
Live Arrival and Departure using Flight Aware Arrival and Departure API
Added Flight Staus feature using Flight Aware API
Added airport information to airport location marker (Note: Some parts of the runways information presented here might be fake generated to display functionality of this feature)
Added airline performance stats based on airport performace data taken from BTS Bureau of Transportation Statistics
