A full-stack project to manage and explore airport, flight, and landing data using PostgreSQL, with plans to add a web interface (Flask/React).

This is a full-stack web app using Flask where I connected a PostgreSQL database, created dynamic routes to serve HTML templates, and returned data via API endpoints. I handled both the backend logic and frontend integration.

World Airport's Data from OpenFlights.org Database
Flight Tracking Data from OpenSky Network
Airport Delays from Flight Aware and Tracking Delays API
