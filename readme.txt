A full-stack project to manage and explore airport, flight, and landing data using PostgreSQL, with plans to add a web interface (Flask/React).

This is a full-stack web app using Flask where I connected a PostgreSQL database, created dynamic routes to serve HTML templates, and returned data via API endpoints. I handled both the backend logic and frontend integration.

There is no real source that was used for this project. 
All the data present in the CSV files were fake and generated by us to accommodate the needs and demonstrate this project implementation.
